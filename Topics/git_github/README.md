# All About Git and GitHub
Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) designed to track changes in source code during software development. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for managing the Linux kernel development, but has since become widely used for version control in all kinds of projects.

While Git itself is just a version control system, platforms like GitHub and GitLab provide additional features for collaboration, such as issue tracking, code review, and continuous integration. These platforms host Git repositories and offer social coding features that make it easier for developers to work together.
